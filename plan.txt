current focus: analyzeArray:

* when analyzeArray is called it will first store a reference to a function called getAverage(arr)
{
    * when getAverage is called, it will create a new variable called tempSum which equals 0
    - then a for loop that goes through the array happens.
       for{
           - on each iteration, this element will add to the tempSum
        }
    - after the for loop, we make a tempAverage variable where we divide the
    tempSum to the array: tempSum / arr.length 
    - it will then return tempAverage
}
- after that, it will store a reference to a function called getMinimum(arr) {
    * when getMinimum is called, it will create a new variable called tempMin which equals 100
    - then a for loop that goes through the array happens.
        for{
            - on each iteration, if this item is smaller than tempMin, than tempMin will equal
            this iteration
            }
    - after the loop, return tempMin
}
- after getMinimum is done, do the opposite function called getMaximum(arr) {
    * when getMaximum is called, it will create a new variable called tempMax which equals 0
    - then a for loop that goes through the array happens.
        for{
            - on each iteration, if this item is bigger than tempMax, than tempMax will equal
            this iteration
            }
    - after the loop, return tempMax
}
- when those functions are done, make a reference to the length of the array called arrLength
- finally, return it all as an object

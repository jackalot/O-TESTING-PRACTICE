current focus: ceaserCipher:
* ceaser cipher will start with an empty string called emptyString
- then it will continue by grabbing the string put into it and make a for loop that loops through
the string.
- on each character there will be a function call to the new function checkCasing (char) {
    * in the beginning of checkCasing, it will get the character, and check if its not a letter
    - else it will check if its a capital using if(char === char.toUpperCase())
    - if it does, it returns true;
    - else it returns false;
}
- after check casing it will then call the function nextLetter(currentChar, casing) {
    * nextLetter will start by creating an array of the alphabet lowercased (we will capitalize it later
    if needed)
    - we make a variable called "index" that equals to finding the indexOf our currentChar in the alphabet
    array.
    - if index is -1
        - return currentChar;
    - else if currentChar is the letter Z
        - make a newChar variable that is the letter A
        - after that, if casing === true, we return newChar.toUpperCase();
        - else we return newChar.toLowerCase();
    - else make a newChar variable that is equal to alphabet.slice(index + 1, index + 2);
        - after that, if casing === true, we return newChar.toUpperCase();
        - else we return newChar.toLowerCase();
